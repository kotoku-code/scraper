## About the project

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications This project was at the end of the Ruby curriculum section. I was asked to create a web scraper with Ruby. I chose to scrape information from the official covid-19 website, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"></a> . My project collects information and live statistics from various countries world-wide.
